Bkgm is a Rust library crate for the classic two-player board game of [Backgammon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backgammon), a timeless pastime with a history dating back nearly 5,000 years to Mesopotamia and Persia. This library provides the tools to implement the game, where players strategically move their fifteen pieces across twenty-four 'points' on the board using dice rolls. The objective is to bear off all pieces before the opponent this combines elements of strategy and luck.

In the world of reinforcement learning, Backgammon has been influential, with Neurogammon, developed by Hans Berliner in the late 1970s, pioneering the use of neural networks for AI gameplay. This paved the way for TD-Gammon, created by Gerald Tesauro in the 1990s, a milestone in AI development that showcased the power of neural networks and self-play in mastering the game.
